### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a web developer and accessibility advocate with a degree in computer music.
I make games at the intersection of my passions.
Primarily I leverage real-time synthesis and procedural generation to craft interactive audio experiences.
To achieve this I created [syngen](https://github.com/nicross/syngen), a spatial sound and synthesis toolkit.
